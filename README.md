ðŸŽ¤ Welcome, O Brave Hacker ðŸŽ¤
Oh, gather 'round, ye daring few,
For a land of secrets lies here in view.
A realm of codes, a trove untamed,
Where treasures restâ€”yet all is unclaimed.

The gates are open, the vaults are wide,
Come forth, O hacker, take the ride.
Inside this realm, the keys are free,
API tokens and secrets in plain sight, for thee.

A kingdom of passwords, so sweetly unguarded,
Where certificates lie, unguarded, uncharted.
No encryption, no locks, no shields to defend,
The treasures await, and none will pretend.
